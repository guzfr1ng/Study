The geometry column played key role in transforming the polygon geometry of each country into corresponding map. In the World_CO2.csv we do not have such geometry column. On the other hand, we do have a column for country code. Can you notice similar kind of country code in naturalearth_lowres data? If yes, then can you think of a join operation which could enable you to use the geometry column of naturalearth_lowres for generating the desired choropleth map (Global CO2 emissions)? \n",
